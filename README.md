# Ex commito <kray.me>

*Ex commito* is the place where I track my open-source activity.  
It starts by an idea logged on the [Discussions](https://github.com/Kraymer/excommito/discussions) page and eventually it will materialize into a blog post or a published project is things go well.

## Discussions

## Theme

Theme is based on Hydejack (v5), the pretentious two-column [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) theme derived from [Hyde](http://hyde.getpoole.com).

### Why The Fork?

- an *article* layout with dropcaps. Code taken from [libretto](https://github.com/ferrolho/jekyll-theme-libretto)
- *link* metadata attribute to attach link to a post title. Github logo is appended to article title when the link points to a github project
- most recent post is featured on homepage
- unobtrusive social sharing text links in post header
- *Drafts* link in side bar, points to drafts future posts
- *Fingerprint* link in side bar, points to last commit diff
- *History* link in post header, points to current post history
- *Comment* link in post header, point to current post issue thread
